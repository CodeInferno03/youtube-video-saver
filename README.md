# youtube-video-saver
A chrome extension that saves youtube shorts

# Notes
A lot of the logic for this is based on [Chrome Extension Documentation](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/get-started), specifically
- [Inject Scripts Into The Active Tab](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/get-started/tutorial/scripts-activetab)
- [Manage Tabs](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/get-started/tutorial/popup-tabs-manager)
\
Some of the elements of the code come from [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/create-a-chrome-extension-in-html-css-javascript/) too


# Planned Features
- ### Ability to Save YouTube Videos through a shortcut
The ability to use a keyboard shortcut (`Ctrl+Shift+Y`, `Cmd+Shift+Y` for MacOS) in order to save YouTube videos or shorts, even when the extension is closed
- ### Ability to view saved videos in a list format
The ability to view the saved videos in a list format. Each entry will have the video title, as well as the date it was saved. On clicking an entry, it would redirect to the video in the browser. I plan to save the video thumbnail too, but that will depend on whether I am able to implement it or not
- ### Stretch Feature - Ability to sort by channel
The ability to sort the videos by channel rather than the default (which is by date saved)
- ### Stretch Feature - Ability to add some notes about each video
The ability to add a little blurb under each saved video, only a few words (likely not more than 30-40)
- ### Stretch Feature - Ability to search for a video or short
The ability to search for specific content

# Finished Features
- ### Ability to view saved videos in a list format
